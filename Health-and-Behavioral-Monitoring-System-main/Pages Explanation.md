# Project Overview

The Health and Behavioral Monitoring System (HBMS) is an intelligent healthcare solution focused on monitoring newborns in real-time.  
It combines physiological and behavioral data from sensors to provide a holistic view of the infant’s health.  
Through secure authentication, live data streaming, AI-powered alerts, and detailed analytics, HBMS ensures early detection of health issues.  
The system is designed to improve neonatal outcomes by empowering healthcare providers with accurate, live, and predictive insights.
